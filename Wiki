##I'll be writing a little in plaintext - 
##I also want to mirror on a Mediawiki, I own a domain,
##inference.online, I want to do something with, 
##and this seems like a good project for that purpose. 

##I'm not a programmer but I do have a little working knowledge of Python,
##my first task here is going to be to write the code out in plain language

##I'm inclined to insert your mom jokes throughout the text as a sort of Easter Egg
